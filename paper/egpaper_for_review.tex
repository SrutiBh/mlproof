%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Automatic cell image segmentation methods in connectomics can lead to \emph{split} and \emph{merge} errors, which require correction through proofreading. To aid error correction, we develop two classifiers that are able to recommend candidate errors and their corrections to the user. These classifiers are informed by training a convolutional neural network with known errors in automatic segmentations by comparison to expert-labeled ground truth. Our network architecture is able to detect potentially erroneous regions by considering a large context region around a segmentation boundary. With recommendations, proofreading of mouse cortex electron microscopy image segmentations can reduce VI scores from 0.476 to 0.426, which we find is an improvement on pure manual and pure automatic cases that both cause VI to increase.
